## Reflection

### Mark

According to the feedback of my team, I have done a very good and thorough research on expo and the redux structure. This really payed off during the development stage. I'm very glad that my input was valuable for the result of our application. Next time I want to be more involved in making the presentation, because I tend to forget those things while developing. I will be very happy to go further with this application during the course Mobile Project.

### Alexandra

I’ve grown and learned a lot during this mobile development. I always wantend to do something with React-native in combination with redux and expo. I’m happy to continue this work in the mobile project and I hope to develop myself even more as a developer and designer. I think we should get a 4 for this project. I think the technologies we chose is really great and innovative. Not to mention that we achieved a lot and we can even do more with the mobile project

### Roman

I prize myself in being an all-round programmer. I like the interaction between Front-end and Back-end and love both sides. This project I've helped with designing certain aspects as well as implementing them.
This also lets me help my fellow programmers whenever they need help in either of these fields. I believe my productivity has been very good during this project and I cannot wait to continue during the upcoming weeks.

### Wessel

In my opinion, i made the most valuable addition to the team in the planning stage. Planning an IT project out is essential in getting it to do what you want. I also did research into Expo to use in the presentation that I mostly made. Furthermore I supplied the data that Roman further refined. I did want to help more with the actual programming, but the timewindow was a bit short. I will however make up for that in Mobile Project.
