## Reflection

### Mark

According to the feedback of my team, I have done a very good and thorough research on expo and the redux structure. This really payed off during the development stage. I'm very glad that my input was valuable for the result of our application. Next time I want to be more involved in making the presentation, because I tend to forget those things while developing. I will be very happy to go further with this application during the course Mobile Project.

In my opinion, i made the most valuable addition to the team in the planning stage. Planning an IT project out is essential in getting it to do what you want. I also did research into Expo to use in the presentation that I mostly made. Furthermore I supplied the data that Roman further refined. I did want to help more with the actual programming, but the timewindow was a bit short. I will however make up for that in Mobile Project.
